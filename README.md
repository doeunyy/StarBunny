# Game Title: Star Bunny

## Description

In this game, you play as an alien bunny flying back to their home planet after a week of vacation. As you are on your way back, the alarm in your ship starts to blare and you are slowly losing control. You take control of the wheel and try to make a landing for the most nearby planet. You spiral down onto planet Earth. You check to see what was the issue and it seems that your ship’s engine has no fuel. Fortunately, earth has the resources needed to fuel your ship, but the inhabitants of earth don’t like invaders. Your goal is to get through the levels and gather enough stars to fix your ship. The people of earth won’t let you get them easily though!

## Game Objects

## Controls

The player will use arrow keys or A and D to move in the respective direction. Space bar will be used to jump.

## Game flow

A cutscene with text dialogue explains the story/situation. The player then will load into the first level. If the player walks into a hazard then the level restarts and they will have to collect all the stars again. Can see a number of stars in the corner of the screen. Levels will be completed progressively meaning in sequential order. Once all the stars are obtained and all levels are beaten, there will be a cutscene of the game ending.

### Cutscene

**First scene:** bunny crashing on earth in the night

**Second scene:** bunny looks at ship fuel gauge and it is out
Third scene: looking at land in front, humans look vicious and vile
(Game play starts)

**Final cutscene:** Ship takes off and dialogue says thank you for playing

## Levels

There will be 4 levels with a total of 3 stars per level. Each level is different from each other. The objective will not change between levels. The background will change in each level which is based on cityscapes. The layout(platform, floor, hazards) will change location on each level.
Each level will have 1 to 2 obstacles.

### Examples

**Level 1:** 
player will appear at the start. Instructions will pop up on the screen one by one to
guide the player on the control scheme. Stars will be placed in easy to reach places to start the
player off so they get used to the controls. There will be 1-2 obstacles to let the player get used
to dealing with obstacles. The 2 obstacles will be thorn bushes to introduce jumping.

**Level 2:**
Obstacles are now in the game that the players will have to avoid while collecting the stars.

**Level 3:**
Enemies are now something the player has to get past. They will attack the player and the
player will have to dodge while collecting the stars.

**Level 4:**
The platforms now move. The player will need to get around while avoiding the enemies and
collecting stars to complete the level.
